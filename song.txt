All the epochs, the ages, the years and so forth
Every creature avoids frost and mist in his house.
How come birds are heading again to the North
If the birds are supposed to fly to the South?

They don’t need any fame, any stateliness,
Soon the ice would be out of sight;
And they’ll find there their birds’ happiness
As reward for a daring flight.

Couldn’t we linger on in a cozy bed?
What compelled us to sail through the salty sea air?
We’ve not seen - it’s a pity! - the northern lights yet,
It does not happen often. The lights are so rare.

No noise. We feed gulls with an empty hand -
They, like lightning, are sparkling around.
The reward after silence we have to stand
Will be certain and sure - sound.
